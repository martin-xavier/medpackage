### CREATING AN EVENT CLASS ###


1) Gather positive training videos that contain the event and background (neutral) videos.
	-> positive and background videos are considered as a single shot
	-> to cut the interesting slice you can use a package such as ffmpeg.

2) Save your videos in the "BASE_DIR/videos" directory (you can organize them in subdirectories for easier handling).

3) Create a directory "BASE_DIR/events/Your_Event_Name".

	-> for event and video names, you can use almost all characters (including spaces)

4) In this directory, create two files:
	-> positive.txt: contains the list of access paths to your positive training videos
	-> background.txt: contains the list of access paths to your "neutral" videos.

	The access paths should be relative to the "BASE_DIR/videos" directory.
	For example:

	"/home/user/event_package/videos/My New Event/example001.mp4"

	           should be listed as

	"My New Event/example001.mp4".


5) Run event_init.sh "My New Event"
	-> no processing is done at this stage

6) event_status.sh "My New Event"
	-> gives useful information about the running processes (descriptor extraction)

7) event_run_descriptor_extraction.sh "My New Event"
	-> currently generates DenseTrack sequentially on all your training videos
	-> it is safe to run multiple instances of this script on a single / multiple events,
	with/without overlapping videos (shared background videos for example)

8) event_run_training.sh "My New Event"
	-> generates the classifier, used to generate scores
