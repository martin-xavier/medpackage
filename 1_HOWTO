### CREATING AN EVENT CLASS ###


1) Gather training videos that contain the event, gather "neutral" videos that will act as background.
	-> training and background videos are considered as a single shot
	-> to cut the interesting slice you can use a package such as ffmpeg.

2) Save your videos in the "BASE_DIR/videos" directory (you can organize them in subdirectories for easier handling).

3) Create a directory "BASE_DIR/events/Your_Event_Name".

4) In this directory, create two files:
	-> training.txt: contains the list of access paths to your training videos
	-> background.txt: contains the list of access paths to your "neutral" videos.

	The access paths should be relative to the "BASE_DIR/videos" directory.
	For example:

	"/home/user/event_package/videos/My_New_Event/example001.mp4"

	           should be listed as

	"My_New_Event/example001.mp4".


5) Run "event_create.sh Your_Event_Name"

This invokes resource-intensive operations.
It compute descriptors for background + training videos before training the event classifier.


6) Once your classifier is generated, you can try to find matches in other videos.
   Run "event_getscores.sh ..." (see usage).
