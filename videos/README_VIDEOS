This folder should contain your videos or a symbolic link to them.
For example, if your videos are stored in "/data/myvideos/", you can use this command:

ln -s /data/myvideos myvideos

All scripts will assume the videos are available in this folder.
The video's name is its unique identifier throughout all steps.
Videos can have any character in their name, including spaces, & = ' .. etc.
